Things that I have not gotten around to doing.

 - IIDX favorites viewer and editor for frontend. The data is all available in profile, but the interface was never built.
 - DDR calorie tracker and workout stats. Again, the data is all available but the interface was never built.
 - Lobby for all games except Reflec Beat. Reflec is the only game with lobby support right now, but this should be fairly easy to add to other games since the backend infra is all there. Correct global IP detection is even built-in to the server and passed forward if you are using a proxy.
 - Prettify the frontend. Its a bit utilitarian right now, aside from some minor color flare.
 - Make the frontend work better on mobile. It works well enough, but it could be a much better experience.
 - Support for DanEvo. I meant to do this but my DanEvo ended up in storage before I could tackle it, so the only thing that exists at the moment is a rudimentary music DB parser.
 - Figure out phase/unlock/etc bits for some older IIDX versions and hook them up to the Arcade panel to allow switching events.
